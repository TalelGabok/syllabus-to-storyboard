## üéì Best Practices

### For Better Results
1. **Start with quality syllabi** - Detailed objectives and curriculum produce better storyboards
2. **Review objectives** - Ensure they're action-oriented and specific
3. **Check timing** - Verify total duration fits your target (3-5 minutes)
4. **Adjust scripts** - Edit for your brand voice and terminology
5. **Consider your audience** - Ensure language and complexity match learner level

### Production Workflow
1. Generate initial storyboard from syllabus
2. Review and edit scripts for clarity and brand voice
3. Adjust timing based on actual voiceover recording speed
4. Export CSV for production team handoff
5. Use JSON for LMS integration or system automation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology
